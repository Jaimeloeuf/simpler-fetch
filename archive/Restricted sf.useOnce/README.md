# Restricted sf.useOnce
This is an archive of an experiment where the `Builder` class is split into 2 so that the useOnce method on `sf` can use the `SimpleBuilder` class that does not have the ability to set default options and header values, since it was assumed that single use API calls should not be dealing with that anyways.

However since library users can save the returned `Builder` instance from `sf.useOnce` in a variable, they could technically still use it as it was originally built, although this is not recommended at all as it breaks the usage flow and manually reuses the `Builder` instances which could potentially cause bugs.
