# Sample
- Sample projects to demonstrate the use of this library in a [`browser environment with a webapp`](./webapp/) and in [`node.js`](./node/)
- Both the webapp and node.js script demonstrates the use of `oof` in particular as that is **the recommended way** to use this library.
- Before any of the projects can be used, the [API server](./server/) must be up and running first.
